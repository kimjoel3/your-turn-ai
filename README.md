Does the code work? If not, what's broken.

Yes, the code runs well.

How is the code better than what the team currently has?

I would argue that it is worse, but only slightly.

How is the code worse?

The lack of firebase linking is something it is lacking, though the UI I believe is better.  Also it added some features such as the progress bar that we haven't added yet.

How many tries did it take to get the code? Main struggles?
