I've created a timer.  It counts down, and lets the user input the time it counts down from.  THere is a start, reset, and set time button.  There is a visual pie chart to show the timer progress. On the click of reset, the queue of people loaded from a json switches to the next person.  The styling was set to being a dark, modern, simplistic theme.



Does the code work? If not, what's broken.

Yes, the code runs well.

How is the code better than what the team currently has?

I would argue that it is worse, but only slightly.

How is the code worse?

The lack of firebase linking is something it is lacking, though the UI I believe is better.  Also it added some features such as the progress bar that we haven't added yet.

How many tries did it take to get the code? Main struggles?

Everything that I attempted to implement was pretty much done it one go.  I stopped at a point where I was trying to implement a drag and drop feature to reorder the queue, which is probably the hardest task I've asked it to do, so I wasn't surprised that I've ran into issues at this point.

Overall impression of the experience

I've used GPT-4 for many uses from helping with coding to looking up topics for class.   Therefore, I understood how powerful it was already.  I'm not at all suprised at its ability to create the app as well as it has so far.  The things that I asked it to do were not all unreasonably difficult.  Additionally, it upgraded me to the GPT-4o, so the abilities were higher than 3.5 . I haven't used 3.5 since I purchased the premium GPT+ subscripiton, so I wonder had I used 3.5 how well it would've done.
